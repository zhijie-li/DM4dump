# DM4dump
Dump GATAN DM4 file information into human-readable format.

The DM4 file format is described in http://www.er-c.org/cbb/info/dmformat/#dm4 

This program will unpack the binary data saved in DM4 files and try to interpret a few most interesting entries such as image dimention, Angstromes per pixle (Apix), etc..

The image data block will be simply skipped.
